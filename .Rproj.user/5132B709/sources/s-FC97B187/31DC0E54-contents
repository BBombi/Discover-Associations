## Models Comparison

Here we'll compare the different models performance, in order to choose the one with best performance metrics.

```{r model plots comparison, echo=FALSE}
#Creation of training and test sets from COMPLETE_RESPONSES####
set.seed(123)

in_train <- createDataPartition(y = complete_responses$brand,
                                p=0.75,
                                list=FALSE)
training <- complete_responses[in_train,]
testing <- complete_responses[-in_train,]

knn_fit <- train(brand~ salary+age, 
                 data = training, 
                 method="knn", 
                 trControl=tr_ctrl, 
                 preProcess=c("center","scale"),
                 tuneLength=15)

plot(knn_fit)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
